## learnSEM

`learnSEM` is a tutorial package to learn structural equation modeling written by Erin M. Buchanan at https://statisticsofdoom.com/.

Current Version: `0.1.0`

### Installation

You can install `learnSEM` by using the following code:

```
#install.packages("devtools") #uncomment if you need devtools
library(devtools)
install_github("doomlab/learnSEM")
```

Be sure to restart your **R** session, as this helps you get the **Tutorial Window** from the `learnr` package. If you see a message *no tutorial found in learnSEM*, try restarting RStudio.
